# Aptos Labs Whitepaper

Pull requests for factual corrections and language errors are welcome! Please do not submit pull requests for stylistic edits that are purely subjective.

Pull requests need not contain a new pdf version. A maintainer can generate the pdf based on recent commits.

## Hints on compilation.

The official way to compile the whitepaper is to upload the language directory to Overleaf. Each language may have different options in Overleaf. Check the language folder's README.
